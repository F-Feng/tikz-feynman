[Ti*k*Z-Feynman](http://jp-ellis.github.io/tikz-feynman)
=======================================================

<b>A new version is coming soon with a few changes (in about 4-5 weeks, after I finish my exams):

* Styles will be in their own proper namespace (to avoid clashing with user-defined styles)
* There will be a `\feynmandiagram` command to simple graphs
* Feynman diagrams will have their own sub-environment (akin to `\begin{axis}...\end{axis}` from pgfplots)
* Better documentation, better examples.

</b>

This package provides a set of pre-defined styles in order to draw Feynman
diagrams using [Ti*k*Z](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf) more easily and
consistently.  The set of styles defined here were originally inspired by
[this answer](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/87395/26980) on
[tex.stackexchange.com](http://tex.stackexchange.com), so due credit must
go to Jake.
