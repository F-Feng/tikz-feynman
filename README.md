=============================================================

[Ti*k*Z](https://www.ctan/org/pkg/pgf) is a fantastic and very powerful
drawing package and Ti*k*Z-Feynman builds upon this to provide an easy way
to produce Feynman diagrams.

I must thank [Jake](http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/2552) for providing
[this answer](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/87395/26980) on
[tex.se](http://tex.stackexchange.com) which initially inspired me to write this
package.

If you have any suggestions or have found any bugs, please feel free to create a
new issue or pull request here on the Github.
