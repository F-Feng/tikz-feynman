{"name":"Tikz-feynman","tagline":"Feynman diagrams in TikZ","body":"Ti*k*Z-Feynman\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis package provides a set of pre-defined styles in order to draw Feynman\r\ndiagrams using [Ti*k*Z](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf) more easily and\r\nconsistently.  The set of styles defined here were originally inspired by\r\n[this answer](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/87395/26980) on\r\n[http://tex.stackexchange.com], so due credit must go to Jake.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions or have found any bugs, please feel free create a\r\nnew issue or pull request here on Github.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis package is *not* currently offered on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org) as it is\r\njust a personal project of mine; however, if enough people find it useful, I\r\nwill look into making it available through CTAN.\r\n\r\nIn order to use this as it is, simply download `tikz-feynman.sty` and place it\r\nin the same directory as your TeX file and include it using the usual\r\n`\\usepackage{tikz-feynman}`.  Alternatively, it is also possible to install\r\n`tikz-feynman` system-wide by placing it inside TeX's search path (which will\r\nvary based on your operating system).\r\n\r\nIn v3.0.0 of Ti*k*Z, there is a bug in the Lua component of the graphdrawing\r\nlibrary which prevents it from handling coordinate nodes properly.  This bug\r\ndoes not seem to affect the usual Ti*k*Z drawing library.  If you wish to use\r\nthe `\\graph` command with any of the options that require Lua, you will need to\r\napply the following patch:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/generic/pgf/graphdrawing/lua/pgf/gd/interface/InterfaceToDisplay.lua\r\n+++ b/generic/pgf/graphdrawing/lua/pgf/gd/interface/InterfaceToDisplay.lua\r\n@@ -263,6 +263,13 @@ end\r\n \r\n function InterfaceToDisplay.createVertex(name, shape, path, height, binding_infos, anchors)\r\n \r\n+  -- The path should never be empty, so we create a trivial path in the provided\r\n+  -- path is empty.  This occurs with the `coordinate` shape for example.\r\n+  if #path == 0 then\r\n+    path:appendMoveto(0, 0)\r\n+    path:appendClosepath()\r\n+  end\r\n+\r\n   -- Setup\r\n   local scope = InterfaceCore.topScope()\r\n   local binding = InterfaceCore.binding\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage and Documentation\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nPlease see [tikz-feynman.pdf](https://github.com/JP-Ellis/tikz-feynman/blob/master/tikz-feynman.pdf).\r\n","google":"UA-62514224-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
